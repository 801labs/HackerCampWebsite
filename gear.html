        <p>It's dangerous to go alone! Take this</p>

        <h2>Hardware:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cell phone and power bank: Works as a camera and GPS!</li>
            <li>Mini Racks, and Network equipment is HIGHLY suggested: Just kidding. Cell service is spotty and may be non-existent in areas. This means we'll be embracing the offline world for our hacking challenges. Don't worry, we've got some great activities planned that don't require computers or internet access – think puzzles, logic problems, and physical challenges.</li>
            <li>Meshtastic devices: They aren't necessary and won't help you with any of the challenges, but we'll have a repeater setup—because who doesn’t love some extra noise?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Camp Gear:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sleeping setup: Sleeping bag, pad, and pillow.</li>
            <li>Camp chair: For comfortable seating around the campfire (and for brainstorming challenges).</li>
            <li>Headlamp or Flashlight: Essential for navigating around the campsite at night.</li>
            <li>Water Bottle: Seriously, bring this. We're not carrying you back to civilization. Stay hydrated!</li>
            <li>Cooler: Check the list below and don't forget ice!</li>
            <li>Toiletries: Deodorant, toothbrush, deodorant, toothpaste, deodorant, soap, etc.</li>
            <li>Toilet paper: There should be some at the vault toilets but let’s not leave it to chance.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen & Bug spray: Protect yourself from the elements.</li>
            <li>First-aid kit: Band-aids, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, etc.</li>
            <li>Multi-tool or Knife: Handy for various tasks.</li>
            <li>Duct tape? For repairs (and maybe some creative hardware hacking?).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Need Gear? Here are some options:</h2>
        <p>If you're new to camping or don't have all the necessary gear, don't worry! There are a few places where you can rent, borrow or buy camping equipment on the cheap:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>University Outdoor Programs/Centers: If you're affiliated with a university (student, faculty, staff, alumni), check their outdoor program or center. They often have affordable gear rentals. (<a href="link">University of Utah Outdoor Adventures</a>, <a href="link">Utah State University Outdoor Program</a>, <a href="link">Brigham Young University Outdoors Unlimited</a>)</li>
            <li>REI (Recreational Equipment, Inc.) and smaller outdoor stores: REI offers a wide range of camping gear for rent at many of their locations. Check their website for availability and pricing: <a href="www.rei.com/rentals">www.rei.com/rentals</a></li>
            <li>KSL Classifieds, Facebook Marketplace, Deseret Industries: You can often find gently used (or sometimes questionably used) equipment at rock-bottom prices. Give used gear a chance (and maybe a wash).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clothing:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Moisture-wicking base layers: These will help regulate your body temperature.</li>
            <li>Insulating layers: Fleece or a light down jacket for warmth, especially in the evenings and early mornings.</li>
            <li>Waterproof/windproof outer layer: A jacket is highly recommended, as spring weather in Utah can be unpredictable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable hiking shoes or boots: Broken-in shoes are best to avoid blisters. We likely do some light hiking around the area.</li>
            <li>Socks: Bring extra pairs, especially wool or synthetic ones.</li>
            <li>Hat: For sun protection and warmth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Food (Bring Your Own!):</h2>

        <h3>Breakfast:</h3>
        <ul>
