            <details>
                <summary>What is HackerCamp?</summary>
                <p>HackerCamp is where tech geeks and wilderness lovers meet for an awesome offline adventure. Think of it like a mini hacking conference… but with more fire and no presenters.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>When is HackerCamp 2025?</summary>
                <p>HackerCamp 2025 is happening from Friday, May 16th to Sunday, May 18th. Mark your calendar and get ready for a weekend of unplugged hacking.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Where is HackerCamp taking place?</summary>
                <p>We’ll be at Maple Grove Campground near Scipio, Utah (see directions below). It’s the perfect place to hack away from the distractions of your digital devices.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What type of activities can I expect at HackerCamp?</summary>
                <p>Get ready for hacking challenges, lock picking, cryptography, knot tying, primitive fire-starting (the O.G. Hot Tech), and maybe even a lively discussion around the fire about "VIM vs Nano vs Emacs" (just kidding). Expect the unexpected.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will there be any workshops or sessions at the event?</summary>
                <p>Calling them workshops and sessions might be a little overzealous. We’ll have activities for everything from wilderness survival skills to analog circuits. You’ll leave camp either an apex survivor or at least know how to social engineer people into believing it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I need any prior experience to attend?</summary>
                <p>Nope! No experience required. We’ll teach you everything from fire-starting to social engineering. Whether you’re a total newbie or a seasoned hacker, we’ve got something for you.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is HackerCamp suitable for kids/beginners?</summary>
                <p>Absolutely! We’ve got challenges for all levels. We’ll teach you everything you need to know (and maybe a few tricks you didn't want to learn). There are no age restrictions, but minors must be accompanied by a guardian. HackerCamp is for everyone.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there activities at HackerCamp for normies who aren't super into tech?</summary>
                <p>We get it, not everyone dreams in binary. For uninitiated analog souls and algorithmically challenged, there's plenty to enjoy. There will be a games table, craft/kids table, socializing by the campfire, Twin Creeks (fishing if you have a license), and there is even talk of a group hike.</p>

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there family rates?</summary>

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What does the tent/RV fee cover?</summary>
                <p>The $5 tent fee or $20 RV fee covers your spot in the wilderness. It’s like a VIP parking pass for your tent or RV, but in the great outdoors.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there refunds if I can’t attend?</summary>
                <p>Sadly, no refunds. But hey, you can always transfer your registration to someone else and live vicariously through their campfire stories.</p>

            <summary>Campsite & Facilities</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there restrooms and showers at the campground?</summary>
                <p>There are vault toilets. No showers. So, if you like nature smells, you’re in for a treat.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there any campfire regulations or restrictions?</summary>
                <p>Yes, designated fire locations only! No one wants to be known as the firebug that killed HackerCamp.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will there be power outlets available to charge devices?</summary>
                <p>Spoiler: there are no power outlets. But hey, that’s the point, right? Bring a power bank and embrace the outdoors. Pro-tip: Multi-port chargers = friend-makers.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is the campground pet-friendly?</summary>
                <p>As much as we love your pets, the campground doesn’t allow them. Service animals are excepted (contact us first). Non-service pets should be the backup to your "DIY Home Security System".</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What are the alternative accommodation options if I don’t want to camp?</summary>
                <p>If you’re a “glamper” (we don’t judge), there are hotels in Scipio and Salina, about 20 minutes away. Just don’t tell anyone you’re not roughing it in the wilderness, or we might revoke your “camping cred.”</p>

            <summary>Travel & Transportation</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>How do I get to Maple Grove Campground?</summary>
                <p>No Sherpa needed. The campground is 19 miles south of Scipio, Utah, from I-15, take US-50 south out of Scipio for 15.1 miles and then turn west on county road 3300 (Maple Grove). (39.016754, -112.089732)</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is there a carpooling or ride-sharing option for attendees?</summary>
                <p>Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to driving. Parking will be tight, carpooling is king.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Where can I park when I arrive at the campground?</summary>
                <p>Let's just say it'll be cozy. Think Tetris, but with cars. Carpooling HIGHLY appreciated. When campground spots fill up, there's overflow parking just outside the entrance. It's a slightly longer walk, but hey, extra steps means more guilt-free s'mores later.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there any nearby towns for additional supplies or services?</summary>
                <p>Yes, Scipio and Salina are about 20 minutes away. Think of them as your tech-free, supply-run lifelines when you need more marshmallows.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is public transportation available to get to the campground?</summary>
                <p>Sadly, public transportation is a no-go. However, if you can afford to take an Uber that far, please remember we are always looking for sponsors. Otherwise, you’ll have to rely on your trusty car or your carpool buddies.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there EV charging stations at the campground?</summary>
                <p>You're kidding right? Charge in Scipio/nearby beforehand. But who knows, maybe it could be a solar HackerCamp project idea for future?!?</p>

            <summary>Safety & Emergency Information</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>How can I stay safe in the wilderness during the event?</summary>
                <p>Follow basic wilderness safety, stay hydrated, and watch out for wildlife (they're mostly acorn fans, not hacker-haters).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is there a first-aid station at the campground?</summary>
                <p>Yes, we’ll have first-aid kits available. But if you manage to hurt yourself trying to hack a S'more, we might need to rethink your strategies.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will there be tent-to-tent searches for illegal soldering irons?</summary>
                <p>As far as we know Caesars "security staff" will not be attending HackerCamp.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What happens if there is bad weather during the weekend?</summary>
                <p>If the weather turns bad, we’ll send out updates. But hey, hacking in the rain sounds like an adventure, right? Pack for all weather!</p>
