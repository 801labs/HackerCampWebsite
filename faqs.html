									<h3>General Information</h3>

									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What is HackerCamp?
										</summary>
										<p>
											HackerCamp is where tech geeks and wilderness lovers meet for an awesome offline adventure. Think of it like a mini hacking conference… but with more fire and no presenters.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What type of activities can I expect at HackerCamp?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Get ready for hacking challenges, lock picking, cryptography, knot tying, primitive fire-starting (the O.G. Hot Tech), and maybe even a lively discussion around the fire about "VIM vs Nano vs Emacs" (just kidding). Expect the unexpected.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Will there be any workshops or sessions at the event?
									</summary>
									<p>
										Calling them workshops and sessions might be a little overzealous. We’ll have activities for everything from wilderness survival skills to analog circuits. You’ll leave camp either an apex survivor or at least know how to social engineer people into believing it.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Do I need any prior experience to attend?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Nope! No experience required. We’ll teach you everything from fire-starting to social engineering. Whether you’re a total newbie or a seasoned hacker, we’ve got something for you.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Is HackerCamp suitable for kids/beginners?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Absolutely! We’ve got challenges for all levels. We’ll teach you everything you need to know (and maybe a few tricks you didn't want to learn). There are no age restrictions, but minors must be accompanied by a guardian. HackerCamp is for everyone.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there activities at HackerCamp for normies who aren't super into tech?
										</summary>
										<p>
											We get it, not everyone dreams in binary. For uninitiated analog souls and algorithmically challenged, there's plenty to enjoy. There will be a games table, craft/kids table, socializing by the campfire, Twin Creeks (fishing if you have a license), and there is even talk of a group hike.
										</p>

									<h3>Registration & Pricing</h3>

									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											How do I register for HackerCamp?
										</summary>
										<p>
											You made it this far into the website and this is your question?!? Just for you: <a href="https://letmegpt.com/search?q=Where%20is%20the%20registration%20link%20on%20HackerCamp.org?" target="_blank">link</a>.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What is included in the ticket price?
										</summary>
										<p>
											The price includes the entire weekend of hacking, learning, and socializing. Just don’t expect high-speed Wi-Fi – we're all about digital survival, not streaming Netflix.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there family rates?
									</summary>
									<p>
										Absolutely! If you’re bringing the whole crew (your immediate family, of course), we offer a family rate of $50.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What does the tent/RV fee cover?
										</summary>
										<p>
											The $5 tent fee or $20 RV fee covers your spot in the wilderness. It’s like a VIP parking pass for your tent or RV, but in the great outdoors.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there refunds if I can’t attend?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Yes, until 15 days before the event. After that you can always transfer your registration to someone else and live vicariously through their campfire stories.
										</p>
									</details>

									<h3>Campground & Facilities</h3>

									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there restrooms and showers at the campground?
										</summary>
										<p>
											There are vault toilets. No showers. So, if you like nature smells, you’re in for a treat.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there any campfire regulations or restrictions?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Yes, designated fire locations only! No one wants to be known as the firebug that killed HackerCamp.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Will there be power outlets available to charge devices?
									</summary>
									<p>
										Spoiler: there are no power outlets. But hey, that’s the point, right? Bring a power bank and embrace the outdoors. Pro-tip: Multi-port chargers = friend-makers.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Is the campground pet-friendly?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Yes, just make sure your furry friend is on a leash at all times—some campers are allergic. Also, according to the campsite rules, horses don't count as pets.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What are the alternative accommodation options if I don’t want to camp?
										</summary>
										<p>
											If you’re a “glamper” (we don’t judge), there are hotels in Payson about 30 minutes away. Just don’t tell anyone you’re not roughing it in the wilderness, or we might revoke your “camping cred.”
										</p>

									<h3>Travel & Transportation</h3>

									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											How do I get to Payson Lakes Campground?
										</summary>
										<p>
											No Sherpa needed. The campground is less than 30 miles south of Provo, Utah, from I-15, take exit 250 onto Payson Main St for about 1.3mi. Then turn left onto UT-198(100 N) for another 1.4 mi. Turn right onto 600 E(Nebo Loop Rd) for 10 miles and turn into the campground. Follow the road for about.5 mi and watch for the group campground signs.  (39.933583, -111.647444)
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Is there a carpooling or ride-sharing option for attendees?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to driving. We don't want to resort to Tetris, but with cars.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Where can I park when I arrive at the campground?
									</summary>
									<p>
										There are spots at the campsite. When campground spots fill up, there's overflow parking just outside the entrance. It's a slightly longer walk, but hey, extra steps means more guilt-free s'mores later.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there any nearby towns for additional supplies or services?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Yes, Payson is about 30 minutes away. Think of it as your tech-free, supply-run lifelines when you need more marshmallows.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Is public transportation available to get to the campground?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Sadly, public transportation is a no-go. However, if you can afford to take an Uber that far, please remember we are always looking for sponsors. Otherwise, you’ll have to rely on your trusty car or your carpool buddies.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Are there EV charging stations at the campground?
										</summary>
										<p>
											You're kidding right? Charge in Payson/nearby beforehand. But who knows, maybe it could be a solar HackerCamp project idea for future?!?
										</p>
									</details>

									<h3>Safety Information</h3>

									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											How can I stay safe in the wilderness during the event?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Follow basic wilderness safety, stay hydrated, and watch out for wildlife (they're mostly acorn fans, not hacker-haters).
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Is there a first-aid station at the campground?
										</summary>
										<p>
											Yes, we’ll have first-aid kits available. But if you manage to hurt yourself trying to hack a S'more, we might need to rethink your strategies.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											Will there be tent-to-tent searches for illegal soldering irons?
									</summary>
									<p>
										As far as we know Caesars "security staff" will not be attending HackerCamp.
										</p>
									</details>
									<details class="faq-item">
										<summary>
											What happens if there is bad weather during the weekend?
										</summary>
										<p>
											If the weather turns bad, we’ll send out updates. But hey, hacking in the rain sounds like an adventure, right? Pack for all weather!
										</p>
