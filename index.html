            <h2>It’s Happening! HackerCamp 2025 is ON!</h2>
            <p>Pack your bags, leave your digital devices behind (for the most part), and join us for an unforgettable weekend of unplugged hacking, epic campfires, and tons of laughs at Maple Grove Campground, nestled near Scipio, Utah, on May 16th-17th.</p>
            <p>This isn’t your average campout; think of it as a mashup of a security conference with a dash of wilderness survival. We’ll be teaching everything from lock picking, to social engineering, and even fire starting. We'll also have board and card games to keep the good vibes going for those members of your party not interested in hacking. No experience? No problem! We welcome everyone from the tech-curious to the seasoned pros. See you at the campfire!</p>
